<h3 style="text-align:center"> WORLD WAR 2 </h3> <br>
<div class="INTRO"> World War 2 (WW2 for short) was the most deadliest war in the world. It all starrted when Hitler decided to invaded Poland on September 1939. In these 3 paragraphs, you will see information about WW2, how soldiers worked and what women did while men were out fighting.  </div>
<br>
<div class="INFORMATION">World War 2 started on 1st of September 1939 and ended on 2nd September 1945. This deadly war had killed approximately 60 million people and some people say it was a continuation of World War 1. The 15 September 1940 was officially named Battle of Britain Day as it was the day when RAF Fighter Command claimed what proved to be a decisive victory over the German Luftwaffe.

  On the night of 25 August 1940 British bombers attacked Berlin and in reprisal the Luftwaffe switched their attack from strategic air defence targets to the cities. The blitz had begun.

  Hitler spoke at the beginning of September about wiping out British cities. Just a few days later, a massive raid involving almost a thousand aircraft in total targeted London's docks.</div>

<h3 style="color:black"> SOLDIERS</h3>
<div class="SOLDIERS"> When war broke out in September 1939, some men volunteered to join the armed services, but Britain could only raise 875,000 men. In 1940, two million British men aged between 19 - 27 years, who were not working in 'reserved occupations', were ordered to fight. This was known as being "called up". They were trained and sent off to war. As well as being "called up" for the army, men could also be 'conscripted' into the Royal Navy or the RAF. Men were also conscripted from 1943 onwards to work down the coalmines of England, Scotland and Wales. 48,000 men were also sent to work in coal mines (the "Bevin Boys"). Their contribution to World War Two was to vitally fuel the war effort from the coalface. (The term 'Bevin Boys' came from the then Minister of Labour and National Service, Ernest Bevin.) </div>
<br>
<h3 style="color:black"> WORKING WOMEN </h3>
<div class="WORKING WOMEN"> In my opinion women played the most important role because they had to make all the weapons for the men so they could use it for the war. If however, women had to take care of the house, then that would risk of plenty of more soldiers dying because they do not have any weapons and if this had never happened, then women would not be having the jobs they have today because most jobs was not "suitable" for women because they were underestimated. This led women to show how capable they were.</div>
